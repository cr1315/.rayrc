# it would be best to be runnable on windows, linux and macos
# well, a bit difficult maybe..
#   first, no function? since function in bash/zsh is different from powershell
#   then, there is no $OS_TYPE in windows,
#     but fortunetely, powershell variables start from `$`
#     but unfortunetely, the test statement is different between windows and linux
#     it would be difficult to write a script runnable on windows, linux and macos
#     maybe I should at least separate windows from others two
#     or, how about using a template engine -> dynamically generate the script to be executed
#       or, separate the install.sh and install.ps1 -> well, I think it's a good idea
#       at least, as far as I know, tomcat do it like this


# for linux, we assume bash
# for macos, we assume zsh
# so, this script should be runnable on both <= it shouldn't be that difficult I think

# we don't have to use some specific shell to run this script I think,
# it just adds some lines into .zshrc or .bashrc


# TODO:
#   1. determine the ostype
#   2. add some the start lines into .bashrc or .zshrc
