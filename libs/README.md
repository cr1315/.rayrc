## Separate Data Plane from Controll Plane

I've learned the concept of separating data plane and controll plane from Databricks' architecture.

When I was first creating the .rayrc for bash and zsh, I found there so many duplicates between them.  
At first, I was just trying to separate the common part from the bash and zsh chunk, but as I did the work for fzf and vim, I suddenly realized I was actually separating the data plane from controll plane.
